This is just as Bitic wants, as it prefers its own solitude. Bitic gathers enormous amounts of energy inside it simply by existing. Often, this energy needs to be released. Bitic releases it by creating large thunder and lightning explosions with it at the center. Those explosions do not harm Bitic, but make craters out of the nearby land. This is why Bitic prefers solitude, as anything near the explosion faces an early death.", rank:"01", isSale:true,main: false},

If the need arises, Carda is more than capable of defending its territory and the Polymon it considers to be its wards.Carda’s more terrifying feature is its roar.
